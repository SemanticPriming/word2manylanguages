**Testing the Assumption of Model Similarity Across Languages** 

*Phillip A. Grim II & Erin M. Buchanan* 

Harrisburg University of Science and Technology  

Presented at the **Society for Computation in Psychology (SCiP)**

## ðŸŽ¤ Description

This presentation explores whether standard model parameters (e.g., embedding dimensions, context window size) yield similar performance across different languages when training word embeddings. Drawing on the Word2ManyLanguages project, we test the common assumption that cross-linguistic embedding structures behave similarly â€” and present results showing wide variation depending on language, norm type, and corpus.
