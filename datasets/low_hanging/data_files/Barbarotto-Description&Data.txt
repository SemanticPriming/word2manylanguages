This index is the overall success rate in the naming of each stimulus, obtained by collapsing the whole sample of participants independently of the children's age. It was calculated separately for boys and girls.PoA is a direct method, and gives continuous values well suited for statistical analyses. A limit of PoA is that the single word values are contingent on our sample of children.(ii) Objective AoA following a 75% rule (AoA-75%)This index is low when a word is acquired early. The method was inspired to the study by Morrison, with some differences in the extreme age groups with respect to the original method (Morrison et al., 1997, see later in this paragraph) in order to obtain a direct measure of the age of acquisition of a given word. To calculate this index we subdivided the whole sample into 6 age groups of 6-month intervals (see Table 1). We considered a word as acquired when 75% or more children of a given age band named it correctly, and when it was also named in the two subsequent age bands. In this case the central value (Table 1) of this age band was given (e.g. 48.5 for the age band 46-51 months, see Table 2). For the outer age groups, at variance with Morrison, we adopted the following strategy. If the naming success reached the 75% level only in the 5th age band (58-63 months) we decided to assign this age band as AoA, although we could check the effective acquisition in only one subsequent band. For the 6th (64-69 months) and last age band of our sample, if the hit rate reached 75% we rated the AoA as 66.5; if the hit rate was less than 75% we rated the age of acquisition as >69 and indicated in brackets the actual percentage of hits observed for this age band. For the 1st age band, if hits were more than 75%, the index was marked as <34 and we also indicated the actual percentage of hits in brackets (see Table 2).(iii) Objective AoA adopting a linear regression model (LRE: linear regression estimate)Also this index is low when a word is acquired early. This procedure, in principle, allows to make a controlled statistical inference about items that have an acquisition age outside the observed age range. The index yields an age of acquisition value in months. For each stimulus we carried out a separate logistic regression analysis: the independent variable was the age in months, and the dependent variable was the response given by each child, coded 1 if it was correct and 0 if wrong. In the logistic regression model we calculated for each stimulus the age at which the expected hit rate corresponded to 75%. We considered as reliable findings the data obtained with the study of logistic regression models of stimuli that yielded at least a significance level of 0.10.; the analysis of the remaining stimuli were no longer considered and are marked as 'na' in the Table 2. The choice of a significance threshold of .10 is the general practice in the single case analysis carried out for diagnostic purposes (Willmes, 1998). In our study we decided to follow a 75% rule, whereas Morrison and colleagues followed a 50% rule:  according to their methodology, the age of acquisition of a given word was the age at which 50% (and not 75%) of the children appeared to have learned the word at issue. Our choice was suggested by the consideration that according to the 50% rule one might declare that a word is 'acquired' even if almost half of the sample were unable to retrieve the name. This seems rather counterintuitive; moreover, two words could be appointed with the same age of acquisition even if, at a given age, one were given the correct name by 51% and the other by 100% of the children. Table 1: Demographic data of the sample.
