Instructions for Imageability Ratings"         In this study we are examining how people rate words. The purpose is to select words to be used in a later experiment. You will see a word on the computer screen such as: splash.         We will ask you to rate how imageable you think the word is using the scale below. When a word is highly imageable, it will quickly and easily arouse a mental image (i.e., a mental pic- ture, sound, or other sensory experience). When a word is not imageable, it is difficult if not impossible to create a mental image of what the word represents in your mind. Use the scale below to rate how easily you can bring to mind a mental image of each word you are presented with. If a word easily and quickly arousesa sensory experience or mental image, it would be given a high imageability rating. If a word is impossible to image, or you are able to create an image of it only after a long delay, then it shouldbe given a low imageability rating. So please rate how imageable you think the following words are using this scale: "				"1_______2_______3_______4_______5_______6_______7 "				"Not at all imageable  "					Highly imageable
