APPENDIX 							The 4,086-word database can be found at http://www.ich.ucl. ac.uk/ich/html/academicunits/behav_brain_sci/database/similarity_words.html. Both OVC and Ph±1 metrics are supplied. The subtypes of neighbors (RNs, CNs, and LNs) are also indicated. Words are sorted by rime, and rimes are sorted by rime neighborhood density (RND, decreasing order). Within RND, words are sorted by spoken lexical frequency. Computerized routines for calculating the neighbors of a target word or nonword are supplied on the same Web site. 							Key to Phonetic Codes 							                                          Vowels                                                              Consonants 							Phonetic Class  Code             Examples                     Occ.
