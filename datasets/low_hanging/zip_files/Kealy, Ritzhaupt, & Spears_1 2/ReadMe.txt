Psychological Norms for Simple Three-Line Graphic Shapes:
About the tables and computer program used in the study.


Tables
Two tables of psychological norms are available as tab-delimited text files and as Excel spreadsheets. The two Excel documents are protected, but protection may be disabled to permit resorting of the entire table by a particular column selected. To unprotect the spreadsheet, choose Tools > Protection > Unprotect Sheet and enter "BRM" (in caps) where indicated. 

Resort the data by doing the following:

1. Select cells B7 to N30 (for Table 1) or B5 to K28 (for Table 2) in the document 
2. Choose Data > Sort from the menu bar 
3. Indicate the column on which to sort and the data order 
4. Specify "No Header Row" in the dialogue box 
  
This will sort all the corresponding columns of data including the images.
