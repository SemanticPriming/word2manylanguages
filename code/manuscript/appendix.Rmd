# Reproducibility

## Manuscript

We used `r sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string` to create this manuscript with the following packages:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
# Grab only packages you explicitly loaded (attached packages)
my_pkgs <- sessioninfo::session_info()$packages %>% as.data.frame()
my_pkgs <- subset(my_pkgs, attached) %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion) 

apa_table(
  my_pkgs,
  colnames = c("Package", "Version"),
  caption = "R packages and versions used in the analyses.",
  note = "Versions correspond to the computational environment at the time of knitting.",
  placement = "H"
)
```
